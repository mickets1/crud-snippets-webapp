A web application to help you manage your code snippets easily. It'll be powered by Node.js and use Express as the framework, along with Mongoose for working with MongoDB.

Code snippets are like handy shortcuts for programmers, saving them time and effort. Our web app will give you a user-friendly interface to organize and store your code snippets effectively.

We chose Node.js because it's fast and scalable, making the app responsive and capable of handling many users at once. Express will speed up development and keep the code organized.

For storing your snippets, we're using MongoDB, a flexible and scalable database. Mongoose will help us work with MongoDB smoothly, making it easy to define schemas, validate data, and perform queries.
